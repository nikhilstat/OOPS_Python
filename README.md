## Object Oriented Programming in Python

This project is an attempt to understand the four pillars of Object oriented programming in Python. 

The concepts learned are transferable to other object oriented programming languages.

The exercises and the project solved here are taken from  Object Oriented Programming in Python by Ghazala Bilquise and Thaeer Kobbaey from 'Higher Colleges of Technology' and Ourania K. Xanthidou from Brunel University London.

This project also teaches how to give a structure to the code and minimize code redundancy.

We can learn how to use private, public attributes and how to use decorators and other functionalities.
